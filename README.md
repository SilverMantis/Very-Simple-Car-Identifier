# Very-Simple-Car-Identifier
a very simple project that tracks cars or similar objects in videos/photos inputted into the program
I wrote this about a year ago when I was very new to coding and especially python so try not to judge the somewhat crappy code lol!

# How this works
The program uses the CV2 module to capture and analyze the contrast of every frame and compares it with a library

# How to Customize
to customize it all you need to do is switch out the file inside the "Media_Analyzed" folder to any video you'd like to be ran by the program
